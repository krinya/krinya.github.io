I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I am a student at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/), Budapest where I am doing my MsC studies at the [Business Analytics](https://economics.ceu.edu/program/master-science-business-analytics) course. 

I created this page to show some of my works which I have done during my university studies. You can access them by clicking "projects" on the top of the page.

My full CV is available [here](files/CV_menyhert_kristof_2018_02.pdf).
