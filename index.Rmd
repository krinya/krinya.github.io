I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I am finishing my studies  at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/), Budapest where I have been doing my MsC studies at the [Business Analytics](https://economics.ceu.edu/program/master-science-business-analytics) course. 

I created this webpage to show some of my projects which I have done during my university studies. You can access them by clicking "projects" tab on the top of the page.

If you are intrested in my full CV, it is available [here](files/kristof_menyhert_cv.pdf).
